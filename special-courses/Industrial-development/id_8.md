## Creating and managing a virtual environment

## [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
*Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.*
