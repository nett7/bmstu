```
Kuhn poker is an extremely simplified form of poker developed by Harold W. Kuhn as a 
simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-information game, amenable to a complete 
game-theoretic analysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only three playing cards, 
for example a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player, which may 
place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, 
the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins.
